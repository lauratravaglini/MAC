# GOALS AND REQUIREMENTS

## Goals.

Economic goals. The app is: a cheap and long-term solution which solves the lack of having professional guides; a straightforward promotional resource. Cultural and educational goals. The app includes: information about the museum and its surroundings; a traditional and an interactive guide. Cognitive goals. The app leverages on meaningfulness and authenticity to create an engaging experience.

## Requirements.

We identified five aspects to focus on and tasks to accomplish in order to develop our application: the back-end built by a programmer; the front-end and all the aesthetic aspects of the app curated by a user experience expert and/or a designer; the historical and scientific accuracy verified by a professional, such as an archeologist in this specific case; a 3D modeller for Augmented Reality.

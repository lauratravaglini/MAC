# CONTEXT

The <mark style="background-color:yellow;">**MAC**</mark> (_Museo Archeologico Carife_) is a small yet fascinating archaeological museum: it aims at disseminating knowledge and new perspectives on the _pre-Roman history of Baronia_ — the area to which Carife belongs.

Twenty years after its original conception, MAC opened to the public in **2019** as the result of the collaboration between the **Municipality of Carife** and the **ABAP Superintendence** of Salerno and Avellino, with the authorization of the General Management of **Mibac**.

In order to better understand the MAC, its history, vision, and organisation we got in touch with **Flavio Castaldo**, the museum director. Mr. Castaldo — who is a professor in literature and archaeologist — agreed to a meeting: we thus had the opportunity to interview him and gather first-hand information about the institution. What follows derives from his words and our research.

## **Carife: an enchanted valley**.

> <mark style="background-color:yellow;">«A traveller reaching Irpinia will come across a number of hills and very narrow valleys. In such a landscape, the Ufita valley represents an exception: here, in fact, a flat landscape opens up as a wide valley surrounded by mountains. The richness of this territory lies in its valley and in the presence of the</mark> <mark style="background-color:yellow;">**Ufita River**</mark><mark style="background-color:yellow;">. »</mark>

**Carife** is a village in Campania (Southern Italy): it lies 30 km away from its province’s capital (Avellino), in the historical and geographical area known as **Baronia**, whose territory stretches across the Apennine watershed line, between the upper and middle valley of the river Ufita.

After several archaeological excavation campaigns carried out in this area, a large amount of remains have been brought to light. These finds bear witness of human presence which go back to the ancient **Neolithic**, up to the **Roman conquest** of the area (III BC) and beyond (**Hellenistic and Byzantine ages**). Of course, the dense and continuous population has been favoured by its geographical position, by the proximity to the Ufita River and its flourishing valley.

## The museum

> <mark style="background-color:yellow;">« The Museum tells the story of Baronia between the</mark> <mark style="background-color:yellow;">**VI and IV century BC**</mark><mark style="background-color:yellow;">, with the findings of the Roman villa expanding this chronological arch to the Roman age (2nd to 1st century). »</mark>

The museum’s origins date back to the 1980s, when **Werner Johannowsky** — an archaeologist of Austrian-Swiss origins[\[^1\]](context.md#footnotes.) — and his collaborators led a series of archaeological missions in Samnium and Irpinia. During one of these expeditions, a necropolis was uncovered between the municipalities of Castel Baronia and Carife.

Since then, a museum was envisioned to preserve, expose and tell the story of these and other findings: after more than twenty years, in 2019, the MAC museum finally came to life.

Today, its three rooms host the rich ceramics and precious grave goods coming from three necropolises and some Roman remains from the late Republican and early Imperial age ( an artisanal complex for the production of bricks and a Roman villa).

### Room one.

> <mark style="background-color:yellow;">«The VI century BC is the heyday of Greek civilization: in this period, the Greek Cuma rises to the peak of its power and comes into conflict with the Etruscan Capua: in this very area (scil. Baronia), political relations between the Tyrrhenian and the Adriatic coasts take place. It is by the end of this century that the Samnite people form and their identity clearly takes shape. »</mark>

Room I exhibits findings from the **Castel Baronia Necropolis**, the most ancient one (VI century BCE): these remains — including some beautiful, early local ceramics and weapons— witness the birth and development of the Samnite ethnos.

### Room two.

> <mark style="background-color:yellow;">«The necropolises in today’s Carife witness the moment of greater economic and political power of this territory: the</mark> <mark style="background-color:yellow;">**IV century.**</mark> <mark style="background-color:yellow;">In this period, Hirpini encountered Romans and the two initially engaged in commercial relationships. Later, conflicts arose which led to the conquest of the peninsula by the Romans.»</mark>

The second room houses archaeological findings from two necropolises in Carife: in particular, they were unearthed in the localities of **Piano La Sala** and **Addolorata**, after which they are named.

The _necropolis of Piano la Sala_ was discovered on the bottom of Ufita valley, close to the river: it dates back to V BCE and consists of pit tombs.

The _necropolis of Addolorata_ is more recent: it dates back to the IV BCE and is located in the upper Ufita valley — a dominant position overlooking the river. It mainly contained chamber tombs made of limestone slabs forming a room with a sloping roof (some of them featured an access corridor known as dromos).

The monumentality of these tombs — along with the luxurious grave goods archaeologists found inside— proves that they were **aristocratic burials**. In the IV century BCE Samnite people — and the tribe of Hirpini in particular— had in fact gained a sound economic and political power, dominated central-southern Italy, stood up to the colonies of Magna Graecia, and was about to meet the Romans — initially as commercial partners and later as enemies in a two-centuries-lasting war.

### Room three.

> <mark style="background-color:yellow;">«Archaeological evidence testifies to the disappearance of the Hirpinian civilization: furnaces of the Roman age have been found that tell us about the moment in which</mark> <mark style="background-color:yellow;">**Irpinia became Roman**</mark><mark style="background-color:yellow;">.»</mark>

The third space is dedicated to the excavation of an artisan complex intended for the production of bricks and ceramics, active between the **late Republican age and the Imperial age** (I BCE). This room is also used as an educational space, enriched by the presence of the **1:1 scale reconstruction of the chamber tomb number 7** (IV century BCE), one of the monumental burials discovered in the archaeological area of ​​the Addolorata.

## Exhibition and curatorial rationale.

> <mark style="background-color:yellow;">«Currently, the exhibition itself is not sufficiently informative, being the late outcome of an old project. »</mark>

As the reader may have figured out, findings are showcased and organised according to:

* The **location** where they were found[\[^2\]](context.md#footnotes.);
* Their **date**.

Although all findings are deeply interconnected (geographically, historically, culturally), **no internal thematic path** currently links the three separate spaces and their content.

In addition, as Mr. Castaldo pointed out, **no regular guides’ service** is provided at the MAC:

> <mark style="background-color:yellow;">«Visitors are currently welcomed by civil service volunteers who have been trained to discuss what is on exhibition. \[…] In addition, some volunteers from Carife, or myself, welcome the most attentive visitors. The Museum is looking forward to organising a professional guide system, for example for schools. »</mark>

### The archaeological area.

> <mark style="background-color:yellow;">«The necropolis of Addolorata is important and interesting, since no other necropolis can be visited in Campania, apart from the fourth-century tombs of the amphitheatre of Capua, Santa Maria Capua Vetere. »</mark>

Despite its historical relevance, **bureaucratic matters** make actual access to the archaeological area in Carife problematic. While the Museum is managed by the municipality of Carife, in fact, the archaeological site is under the jurisdiction of the **Archaeological Superintendence**. It is therefore impossible for the Museum to make any kind of intervention in the area, which is nonetheless badly maintained and not conforming to the required and desirable standards for visitor’s access. However, the Museum holds the keys of the site, and opens it up for interested visitors — under the staff’s keen eye, of course. Despite being extremely close to each other (500 metres) and deeply connected, the Museum and the sites belong to different and currently incompatible dimensions: <mark style="background-color:yellow;">«Geographical closeness does not coincide with regulatory proximity»,</mark> as Mr. Castaldo puts it.

## The visitors.

> <mark style="background-color:yellow;">«Most of the visitors are school students: in addition, local history enthusiasts come to the Museum. »</mark>

Visitors are mainly **students** from middle and high school: the Museum management is especially concerned about the educational potential of its holdings. As we have already pointed out, in fact, part of the third room is dedicated to a tomb reproduction for learning purposes. To further enhance the **educational experience** at the Museum, Mr. Castaldo is looking forward to setting up a professional and specialised welcome and guides’ service for schools, despite the scarcity of financial resources.

In addition to the youngest, the museum is mainly visited by local **history/archaeology enthusiasts or connoisseurs**.

## Ongoing/future projects and perspectives.

### Expanding.

> <mark style="background-color:yellow;">«The territory of Baronia is extremely rich, archaeologically speaking: currently, the museum tells a small chronological span, if compared to the historical relevance of the area. »</mark>

The Museum’s exhibits cover a narrow timeframe: exposed materials belong to the **VI, V, and IV centuries BCE**, and from the beginnings of the Roman age. Its deposit, though, stores findings from the prehistoric era, as well as much more material from the three necropolises and from a Roman Villa. Finally, the **Hellenistic** and **Roman necropolises** which have been unearthed in the surrounding area have not been studied or exhibited at all.

### Digitising.

The **University of Salerno** is testing a new 3D portable scanner on some materials in the Museum. It would be possible to:

* View the materials by placing them in a context (VR or AR);
* Use a 3D printer to reproduce the finds, to be enjoyed by blind visitors and others.

Unfortunately, the bureaucratic and funding times are long.

### Archaeological walks.

Considering the archaeological richness of the territory, an archaeological walk throughout the Ufita valley and its sites has recently been organised. In this way, the visitors have not only had the opportunity to get to know the musealised findings materials, but also the sites where they were originally found. Unfortunately, **no indications or signalled paths** are present to guide visitors without specialised guides to address and direct them.

## Footnotes.

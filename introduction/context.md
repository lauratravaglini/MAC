# CONTEXT

## **Carife: an enchanted valley**.&#x20;

> «A traveller reaching Irpinia will come across a number of hills and very narrow valleys. In such a landscape, the Ufita valley represents an exception: here, in fact, a flat landscape opens up as a wide valley surrounded by mountains. The richness of this territory lies in its valley and in the presence of the Ufita River. »

Carife is a village in Campania, Southern Italy: it lies about 30km from Avellino — of which province it is part —, in the historical and geographical area known as Baronia. The territory of Baronia stretches across the Apennine watershed line, between the upper and middle valley of the river Ufita. The repeated archaeological excavations carried out in this area have brought to light a large amount of remains which testify that human presence in this area dates back to the ancient Neolithic, and flourished up to the Roman conquest (III BC) and beyond (Hellenistic and Byzantine ages). Of course, the early, dense and continuous population has been favoured by the geographical condition of the Ufita River and its valley.

## The museum

> « The Museum tells the story of Baronia between the VI and IV century BC, with the findings of the Roman villa expanding this chronological arch to the Roman age (2nd to 1st century). »&#x20;

The museum’s origins are to be found back to the'80s, when Werner Johannowsky —an archaeologist of Austrian-Swiss origins — and his collaborators led a series of archaeological missions in Samnium and Irpinia. During one of these expeditions, a necropolis was uncovered in the municipalities of Castel Baronia and Carife, where the finds were most concentrated. Since then, a museum was envisioned to preserve, expose and tell the story of these findings: in 2019, the museum finally saw the light. The MAC’s three rooms host the rich ceramics and precious ornamental grave goods coming from two different necropolises, some findings from a villa from the Roman age and the remains of an artisanal complex for the production of bricks of the I-II century. A.D.

### Room one.&#x20;

> «The VI century BC is the heyday of Greek civilization: in this period, the Greek Cuma rises to the peak of its power and comes into conflict with the Etruscan Capua: in this very area (scil. Baronia), political relations between the Tyrrhenian and the Adriatic coasts take place. It is by the end of this century that the Samnite people form and their identity clearly takes shape. »

In the first room findings are exposed from the Necropolis of Castel Baronia, the most ancient one (VI century BC): they tell about the birth and first developments of Samnites people’s customs and identity in this area.&#x20;

### Room two.&#x20;

«The necropolises in today’s Carife witness the moment of greater economic and political power of this territory: the IV century. In this period, Hirpini encountered Romans and the two initially engaged in commercial relationships. Later, conflicts arose which led to the conquest of the peninsula by the Romans. » The second room houses the archaeological findings coming from two necropolises found in two different localities in Carife —Piano La Sala and Addolorata — after which they are named The necropolis of Piano la Sala was discovered on the bottom of Ufita valley, close to the river: it dates back to V BC and is composed of pit tombs. The necropolis of Addolorata is more recent (IV BC). It is located in a particular position: upper in the valley, it dominates the river. In it, chamber tombs were found, which were made up of limestone slabs forming a room with sloping roof (some of them featured an access corridor known as dromos). The monumentality of these tombs — along with the very rich grave goods found in them — proves that aristocrats were buried inside them. In the IV century, in fact, Samnite people, and in particular the tribe of Hirpini, populating this area, is no longer just forming (as it was in the VI century). On the contrary, it has gained sound economic and political power, dominates central-southern Italy, stands up to the colonies of Magna Graecia, and is about to meet the Romans — firstly as commercial partners and later as enemies for a two-centuries-lasting war.

### Room three.&#x20;

«Archaeological evidence testifies to the disappearance of the Hirpinian civilization: furnaces of the Roman age have been found that tell us about the moment in which Irpinia became Roman. » The third space is dedicated to the excavation of an artisan complex intended for the production of bricks and ceramics, active between the late Republican age and the Imperial age. This room is also used as an educational space, enriched by the presence of the 1: 1 scale reconstruction of the chamber tomb 7 (IV century BC) which reproduces one of the monumental burials discovered in the archaeological area of ​​the Addolorata.

### Exhibition and curatorial rationale.&#x20;

«Currently, the exhibition itself is not sufficiently informative, being the late outcome of an old project. » As the reader may have figured out, findings are showcased and organised according to: The location where they were found and consequently To their date. Although all findings are deeply interconnected (geographically, historically, culturally), no internal thematic path currently links the three separate spaces and their content. In addition, as Mr. Castaldo pointed out, no regular guides’ service is provided at the MAC: «Visitors are currently welcomed by civil service volunteers who have been trained to discuss what is on exhibition. \[…] In addition, some volunteers from Carife, or myself, welcome the most attentive visitors. The Museum is looking forward to organising a professional guide system, for example for schools. »

### The archaeological area.&#x20;

«The necropolis of Addolorata is important and interesting, since no other necropolis can be visited in Campania, apart from the fourth-century tombs of the amphitheatre of Capua, Santa Maria Capua Vetere. » Despite its historical relevance, bureaucratic matters make actual access to the archaeological area in Carife problematic. While the Museum is managed by the municipality of Carife, in fact, the archaeological site is under the jurisdiction of the Archaeological Superintendence. It is therefore impossible for the Museum to make any kind of intervention in the area, which is nonetheless badly maintained and not conforming to required and desirable standards for visitor’s access. However, the Museum holds the keys of the site, and opens it up for interested visitors: under the staff’s keen eye, of course. Despite being extremely close to each other (500 metres) and deeply connected, the Museum and the sites belong to different and currently incompatible dimensions: «Geographical closeness does not coincide with regulatory proximity», as Mr. Castaldo puts it.

### The visitors.&#x20;

> «Most of the visitors are school students: in addition, local history enthusiasts come to the Museum. »&#x20;

Visitors are mainly students from middle and high school: the Museum management is especially concerned about the educational potential of its holdings, and any other related resource. As we have pointed out, in fact, part of the third room is dedicated to an educational space. To further enhance the educational experience at the Museum, Mr. Castaldo is looking forward to setting up a professional and specialised welcome and guiding service for schools, despite the scarcity of financial resources. In addition to the youngest, the museum is mainly visited by local history/archaeology enthusiasts or connoisseurs.

### Ongoing/future projects and perspectives. Expanding.&#x20;

«The territory of Baronia is extremely rich, archaeologically speaking: currently, the museum tells a small chronological span, if compared to the historical relevance of the area. »

The Museum’s exhibits cover a limited chronological span: exposed materials come from the VI, V and IV centuries BC and from the beginnings of the Roman age. The Museum deposit, though, contains findings from the prehistoric age, in addition to many more materials from the necropolises and from a Roman Villa. Necropolis from the Hellenistic and Roman age that have not been studied and exhibited at all. Digitising. The University of Salerno is testing a new 3D portable scanner on some materials in the Museum. It would be possible to: To view the materials by placing them in a context (VR or AR); To use a 3D printer to reproduce the finds, to be enjoyed by blind visitors and others. Unfortunately, the bureaucratic and funding times are long. Archaeological walks. Considering the archaeological richness of the territory, an archaeological walk throughout the Ufita valley and its sites has recently been organised. In this way, the visitors have not only had the opportunity to get to know the musealised findings materials, but also the sites where they were originally found. Unfortunately, no indications or signalled paths are present to guide visitors without specialised guides to address and direct them.&#x20;

# INTRODUCTION

The **MAC (Museo Archeologico Carife)** is a small yet precious archaeological museum which aims at disseminating information and knowledge about the pre-Roman history of Baronia — the area to which Carife belongs. Twenty years after its original conception, MAC opened to the public in 2019 as the result of the collaboration between the Municipality of Carife and the ABAP Superintendence of Salerno and Avellino, with the authorization of the General Management of Mibac. In order to better understand the MAC, its history, vision and organisation we got in touch with Flavio Castaldo, the museum director. Mr. Castaldo — who is a professor in literature and archaeologist — agreed to a meeting: we thus had the opportunity to interview him and gather first-hand information about the museum. What follows derives from his words and our research.

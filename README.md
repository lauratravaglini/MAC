# INTRODUCTION

This paper presents the <mark style="background-color:yellow;">**MAC App**</mark>, an application designed for an italian archaeological museum in the Avellino province, the **Museo Archeologico Carife**.&#x20;

Since the application was intended to be tailored specifically to this museum, a thorough **investigation** about the MAC’s history, location, holdings, assets, weaknesses and ambitions preceded the actual design process.&#x20;

All things considered, we concluded that an **application** would be the best fit for the museum’s needs and ambitions. The prototyped app we designed has a _double function_: on the one hand, the MAC App represents a **collector of information** — an all-inclusive container of accessible data to get to know the museum and explore it; on the other hand, it serves as a **guide**.&#x20;

In fact, not only does it feature a **traditional guide** (containing written and audio contents), but also — and most importantly — an **interactive one**. The latter is organised according to _three different thematic paths_: by choosing one of them, the visitors will be engaged in a captivating treasure hunt guiding them through the Museum’s holdings.
